Sliding Menu
===========

A sample Android project to explore creating slide-in menus like in the Spotify and Facebook applications. You may use it in your Android apps provided that you cite this project and include the license in your app. Thanks!

Here's a YouTube video of it in action :  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfR9kR55E8I
And you can follow the project on Twitter : [@SlidingMenu][1]

How to Use
==========
In order to integrate Sliding Menu into your own projects you can do one of two things.

1 - You can embed the SlidingMenu at the Activity level by making your Activity extend SlidingMenuActivity.
If you choose to do it this way, you have access to a built-in ActionBar via Jake Wharton's [ActionBarSherlock][2].
The ActionBar will slide with the "above" portion of the Sliding Menu.

2 - You can use the SlidingMenu view directly in your xml layouts or programmatically in you Java code.
